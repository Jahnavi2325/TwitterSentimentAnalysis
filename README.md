# TwitterSentimentAnalysis
##### Problem Statement:

The goal of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on tweets to determine whether each tweet expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Sentiment analysis will help us understand the overall sentiment of the Twitter users towards a particular topic, brand, or event.

This project involves classifying tweets as positive or negative sentiment, focusing on hate speech identification. The model distinguishes between racist/sexist and non-offensive tweets using labeled data. The application includes assessing marketing campaign impact and predicting stock market trends based on sentiment analysis of social media content.

##### Data Preprocessing:

Data preprocessing plays a pivotal role in refining Twitter data for accurate sentiment analysis. The process involves several critical phases to ensure data quality and suitability for machine learning. Here's a concise summary of the essential data preprocessing steps:

###### 1. Raw Data Cleaning:

Convert Text to Lowercase: Standardize text case to reduce vocabulary size and variation.
Remove Mentions: Exclude '@mentions' to eliminate irrelevant user references.
Eliminate Special Characters: Strip punctuation and special characters for uniformity.
Filter Out Stopwords: Discard common, non-informative words ('the,' 'is,' 'and,' etc.).
Hyperlink Removal: Omit URLs, which don't contribute to sentiment analysis.
###### 2. Tokenization:

Tokenization Breaks text into individual words (tokens) for analysis.
Tokens serve as input features for machine learning algorithms.
###### 3. Stemming:

Stemming reduces words to their base form (stem) to capture core meanings.
For instance, 'satisfying,' 'satisfaction,' and 'satisfied' all stem to 'satisfy.'
###### 4. Vectorization:

Convert Tokens to Numeric Representation using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
Numeric vectors facilitate machine learning model input.
###### 5. Dataset Splitting:

Divide Preprocessed Data into Training and Testing Sets for model evaluation.
Effective data preprocessing enhances data quality, ensures consistency, and simplifies feature extraction, enabling sentiment analysis models to learn patterns accurately and achieve robust sentiment classification.
