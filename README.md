# TwitterSentimentAnalysis
##### Problem Statement:

The goal of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on tweets to determine whether each tweet expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Sentiment analysis will help us understand the overall sentiment of the Twitter users towards a particular topic, brand, or event.

This project involves classifying tweets as positive or negative sentiment, focusing on hate speech identification. The model distinguishes between racist/sexist and non-offensive tweets using labeled data. The application includes assessing marketing campaign impact and predicting stock market trends based on sentiment analysis of social media content.
